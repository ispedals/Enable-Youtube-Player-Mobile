# Enable Youtube Player Mobile

[AMO Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enable-youtube-player-mobile/)

Adds a site-specific override for Firefox for Android to spoof the Chrome useragent for m.youtube.com. This allows videos to play in the browser instead of playing in the native app.
Site-specific override support was only added in Firefox for Android 22

##Changelog

* 0.4
Fix install.rdf to state that the addon is only compatible with Firefox for Android 22+

	`cfx xpi --force-mobile` defaults to enabling compatability with both Firefox for Desktop and Firefox for Android.
	Fixing this requires manually editing the generated install.rdf

* 0.3
Rename, relicence, and submit to AMO. Update useragent to Chrome 33 and Android 4.4

* 0.2
Update useragent to Chrome 29

* 0.1
Initial release
